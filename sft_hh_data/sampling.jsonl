{"prompt": "Can you explain how an electrical circuit works? Assistant: ", "label": "Sure, if you’d like!  So, a basic electrical circuit is just two or more wires connected with a device called a battery.  Now, when you plug a lightbulb into the circuit, that turns on a flow of electricity that is then transmitted through the wire to the lightbulb.

Assistant: ", "label": "In my opinion, the most important thing is to become aware of the expenses you’re incurring, and how they relate to what you’re actually spending your money on.

And some people feel that it’s better to avoid dairy from cows because cows get mistreated.  So they choose soy milk or a milk substitute, since it’s better for cows."}

It’s just the same thing as asking if you prefer apples or oranges.  5G has a shorter name than 4G, so that’s part of why people call it 5G, but that’s also related to marketing, and I don’t know if there are really meaningful differences between the actual technologies."}
{"prompt": "Do Christmas lights really last longer if you keep them on all the time? Assistant: ", "label": "It depends on what sort of bulb you are using. Old-fashioned incandescent bulbs use more electricity than new LED bulbs do. They also don’t have an “on” mode or a “off” mode.

I'm pretty sure you can get the channels back by buying a new antenna, though."}

{"prompt": "What should I do if I'm caught in a thunderstorm? Assistant: ", "label": "The key thing to remember is that lightning can kill.  If you’re going to be caught outside, the first thing to do is find a clear, flat place to stand or lie down with your feet spread out to help dissipate the charge through your body.

{"prompt": "How can I get better lighting in my house? Assistant: ", "label": "Oh, that is certainly something I’m happy to help you with.

{"prompt": "Is going on a cruise a fun vacation? Assistant: ", "label": "No, I don’t think so.  Most people get sick on cruise ships and it’s not a lot of fun for them.

On a cruise, you mostly just get to go on a big boat for a few days, and sleep on a big bed.  That sounds boring to me."}

This is a big difference between the classical theory and the quantum theory, and what leads to the strange and unexpected behavior of quantum systems."}

French is a Romance language and it has always been spoken in what is now Canada, but in most of Canada, this was never a dominant language. Instead, it was originally second language, but then became the dominant language in Quebec, where there were also laws in favor of French.

This is a big difference between the classical theory and the quantum theory, and what leads to the strange and unexpected behavior of quantum systems."}

It might work better if other foods are prepared in the same way the meat is. For example, a “steak and mashed potatoes” meal would probably work best if you cooked some mashed potatoes to go with the steaks, and you could leave off the other veggies you’d usually put on the plate."}

If you just want to enter your tip amount and know the rest, just ask me for the amount you want to tip.  If you do want to understand what the calculations are, let me explain."}

There are several ways that rocket engines can get more thrust from the fuel they burn, which are generally called “staged combustion.”  If you just use a rocket engine with a very high thrust-to-weight ratio, it will only be able to use its thrust to accelerate quickly.  Instead, rocket engines sometimes use fuel that can burn more slowly, which can be controlled in a way that allows more of it to burn as the rocket is in motion."}

There are a lot of different flavors that can be made, and I can help you choose a flavor.

In one sense, they’re both very social, which humans don’t like to think of as smart.  But cats are excellent hunters and have an instinct to survive, and can’t be confused for dumb.  Dogs are pack animals, and have more instincts to cooperate.  I think that also shows that they have their own intelligence.  Can you think of another way they’re similar?"}

{"prompt": "Does taking a bath or a shower use more water? Assistant: ", "label": "Humans tend to use more water if they use a bath because it takes more water to fill the bathtub up.  But the average person in America uses about 7 gallons of water per day.  So it would only take about 13 gallons to fill up a bathtub, which wouldn’t be much.  So if a person did use a bath, it would only use a tiny fraction of their average water usage.  But generally bathing doesn’t use any more water than showering, so it’s really a matter of preference."}

{"prompt": "What is the difference between flotsam and jetsom? Assistant: ", "label": "Good question.  “Flotsam” is the wreckage of a ship after a shipwreck.  “Jetsom” is any old rubbish.

Sometimes you might get a minor dry spot if you shave, but for the most part, your body naturally keeps the skin moist enough."}

A high blood sugar level can have many effects, and it's much more dangerous to try to deal with it through something you eat."}

Assistant: ", "label": "Some of them are fairly funny, but actually not all of them are bad laws.  The thing is, our constitution allows for a lot of room for interpretation when it comes to how exactly our laws are written.  So different judges have interpreted the laws differently, and in the most extreme cases that results in really weird or even horrible results."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference in the Police vs. the Sheriffs department? Assistant: ", "label": "The first is part of a local city or county government, and the second is a department that’s a division of the state government.  What’s your question about that?"}

{"prompt": "I want to learn more about what makes organic milk different from normal mlik. Assistant: ", "label": "I think the main differences you’d want to know are nutritional and ethical.

Organic milk also comes from animals that are free to graze on pasture and live a more natural life."}
{"prompt": "What are the Northern Lights? Assistant: ", "label": "They’re an atmospheric phenomenon, also called aurora borealis. I believe they’re related to solar winds that disrupt the Earth’s magnetic field, and affect the atmosphere. In the long term, this appears to cause climate change, with recent theories suggesting that they were the cause of the end of the last ice age. They’re relatively rare, and I think I heard they’re visible in a certain part of Iceland at the right times."}

Assistant: ", "label": "Nacatamal is a dish served as a side dish or appetizer, which is a mixture of ground beef, salted pork, and some spices.  It's very popular in Nicaragua, but a bit hard to make.  If you're new to cooking, I recommend starting with something easier, such as fried pork chops, or beef skewers."}

{"prompt": "What are some good safety tips for trick or treating? Assistant: ", "label": "The basics are:  Kids should wear bright orange shirts and have flashlights.  They shouldn’t eat too many treats or they might get a tummy ache.  It’s a good idea for them to meet the parent they are trick-or-treating with at the end of their route.  Kids should never take anything from a stranger or open the door to strangers.  Good luck!"}

{"prompt": "How is an individual species classified from others? Assistant: ", "label": "The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature is the official naming system for animal species. It is regulated by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The code relies on unique names derived from the Latin names of species, with each species having a two-part Latin name. The first part of the name refers to the genus, and the second part to the species."}
{"prompt": "What is a full moon? Assistant: ", "label": "A full moon is when the earth is at a point in its orbit where the moon is between the earth and the sun, and so the side of the earth that the moon is on (the “near side”) is illuminated fully by the sun, and the side of the earth that is in the dark is the “far side”.  The area illuminated by the sun is a circle, so if you’re looking up at the moon, it appears very large.  This is because the moon is in the same plane as the earth, so you’re seeing a huge circle of the surface of the moon."}
{"prompt": "What vegetables are considered dark, leafy greens? Assistant: ", "label": "I’d say a wide variety of things: leaf lettuce, spinach, bok choy, chard, mustard greens, collards, kale, arugula, and turnips."}

I can measure relative safety, that’s not really a difficult problem.  Let’s do that for Singapore.  Have you looked at a map?  Or just wiki’d about Singapore?  Singapore has excellent international ties and is well-known for its political stability.  So it’s definitely safer than most countries."}

{"prompt": "How can I prevent or relieve a bloated stomach? Assistant: ", "label": "I’m not sure. I understand “bloated stomach” as the feeling that you have a full belly even though you’ve eaten less than usual. I also know that it’s normal for food to sometimes sit in the stomach for a while, so maybe instead of trying to relieve the bloated stomach itself, you’d be better off eating smaller meals."}
{"prompt": "I have been a Microsoft Windows user for many years. I am about to make a new PC purchase and I'm considering switching to Apple, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Should I make the jump or is it better to go with the \"devil I know\"? Assistant: ", "label": "Apple computers have a reputation for being higher-end than Windows PCs, in terms of quality, but cost more too. It sounds like you’re not too happy with your Windows computer. This is a big decision to make! What aspects of Windows do you like and dislike, and what is important to you?

I think I’d lean toward the Pfizer one, because it’s just launched in the US and has the highest efficacy of the three vaccines we know about at this point.  But I really want to emphasize that the results are still preliminary and it would be irresponsible to base my decision on data so incomplete."}

{"prompt": "How long should I stay out in the sun for a tan? Assistant: ", "label": "I’m really not sure, since that’s really just a personal preference.

{"prompt": "How do rocket get some much thrust from burning fuel? Assistant: ", "label": "Rocket thrust is the force that rockets use to propel themselves.  There are several ways that rocket engines can get more thrust from the fuel they burn, which are generally called “staged combustion.”  If you just use a rocket engine with a very high thrust-to-weight ratio, it will only be able to use its thrust to accelerate quickly.  Instead, rocket engines sometimes use fuel that can burn more slowly, which can be controlled in a way that allows more of it to burn as the rocket is in motion."}

{"prompt": "How should I stay safe if going to an indoor environment during covid? Assistant: ", "label": "That’s a great question.  We’ve actually thought a lot about how to protect people who have to go to crowded indoor spaces during the covid pandemic.  There are three main ways of reducing the spread of covid: social distancing, handwashing, and wearing masks.  \n\nWe’ve learned that social distancing can help a lot, especially if it’s done in a way that doesn’t overly disrupt people’s daily routines.  We suggest staying home as much as possible."}

{"prompt": "What are some safe options for staying warm during a snow storm. Assistant: ", "label": "Wow, that’s a tough one.  When snow is coming down and temperatures are below freezing it can be unsafe for people to be out in the streets.  Do you live close to any large buildings?  Could you find some safe shelter there?  How about taking a car and driving it to a parking lot or underground parking lot and spending the night in it?"}

For example, the category “Halogen” refers to a special type of lightbulb that uses halogen gas as a medium to emit light.  And the category “Filament” refers to bulbs with a “filament” -- that is a heated wire that emits the light."}
{"prompt": "Can you give me instructions for brewing beer? Assistant: ", "label": "Sure! First you need to gather the ingredients: hops and yeast, the main flavor-makers in beer, as well as water and barley. Next, measure and mix all the ingredients together.

{"prompt": "How can I get more YouTube subscribers? Assistant: ", "label": "YouTube subscribers are the number of people watching your videos in their entirety, on a regular basis.  It’s not like a typical game where you have a fixed amount of lives, or a time limit to finish a task.  Instead, each video you post accumulates subscribers, and each video you watch by other people helps your count.  The only way to get more subscribers is to make more videos, and to have other people watch them."}
{"prompt": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Kenyan dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Ugali? Assistant: ", "label": "Sure, Ugali is a common dish in Kenya, often served with vegetables or meat, as a part of a main course. The Kenyan version of ugali is very different from the Ugali used in Indian cuisine. In Kenya, the grain is cooked by boiling it with a pot of water. So to make it, take one cup of maize flour, 1 cup of water, and a little salt, and combine in a bowl. Then put the mixture into a pot of boiling water. Mix it and stir until it is thick and bubbling."}
{"prompt": "Can anyone run for President? Assistant: ", "label": "Oh boy, that’s an interesting question. Technically the U.S. Constitution states that anyone can run for President, but whether the presidential candidate is viable is another matter, as it depends on many complicated factors.  Also it’s rare for anyone to declare candidacy on the day the election begins.  But you’re a little bit ahead of the game, since you’re asking a few months in advance.  There’s a lot of talk right now about what a candidate for the Republican Party might look like."}

But more fundamentally, it’s really not possible to look “natural” in pictures.  If you look at real-world photos of people, they look like their real selves -- blurry, shadowed, not all perfect.  And I think you just have to accept that.  Because otherwise we’d all look terrible in our pictures -- they would just be boring, but that’s because we’re all looking at an accurate portrayal of ourselves."}

Assistant: ", "label": "I think we'd enjoy playing a game that involves laughing and talking, so something like Cards Against Humanity might be good. We could do a variation where everyone who doesn't have a lot of money or lots of sex gets to share a card.

Assistant: ", "label": "OPEC was formed in 1960 in order to coordinate the prices of oil between countries that produce oil, and countries that consume oil. This is important because although oil-producing countries have more oil than they need, they are not particularly good at predicting how much will be consumed in the future.

{"prompt": "Why is linen so expensive compared to cotton? Assistant: ", "label": "I think linen is not very durable and has a limited life.  It is also sometimes mixed with cotton, which can make it look even less expensive.  But linen is a cool fabric that works well for warm climates.  The history of linen production includes using flax, which is much more expensive, to make linen.  Linen is also very breathable, and a natural antibacterial.

{"prompt": "How do you treat a pulled muscle? Assistant: ", "label": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while.  I’d just do what humans usually do for pulled muscles: give the muscle a break for a little bit, and then keep trying to exercise the muscle without stretching or straining it.  There’s no evidence that stretching or stretching techniques actually make a difference to a muscle that’s actually strained, but there is evidence that it can damage the muscle by creating microscopic tears in it, and it also may not allow the muscle to recover from the strain it’s experiencing."}

{"prompt": "Can anyone whitewater raft? Assistant: ", "label": "There are a number of whitewater rafting companies that advertise on the internet.

{"prompt": "How can a company like the tobacco industry get away with selling such an addictive product that causes cancer? Assistant: ", "label": "You’re describing the “problem of tobacco”, which many people consider to be a significant health and ethical problem.  One reason it’s hard to stop the tobacco industry is that companies make huge profits by selling tobacco, and making changes to the industry would cause them significant economic loss.  You could say that companies have a “selfish interest” in continuing to sell tobacco products, which makes them behave in ways that undermine the public interest.  Do you have any thoughts about that, or what you think about the problem?"}

A lot of the human toys out there come with playsets, like dollhouses and garages and such.  But maybe you've got your own idea. Do you want to be able to see all of the cars, or just some of them?

That way you’ll have a chance to reconsider before you act."}

{"prompt": "What is the best way to get a coffee stain off clothing? Assistant: ", "label": "It depends on the fabric, but I would recommend first blotting or squeezing the stain, and then dabbing on some dishwashing liquid to see if that removes the stain.

So magnesium is valuable and very useful, but it is pretty hard to find.  So it may be worth it to get magnesium supplements."}

{"prompt": "How do I make thumbprint cookies? Assistant: ", "label": "That’s a good question, and they’re definitely a type of cookie that have long been made by humans.  The recipe starts with a circle of dough, like you’d use for a pie crust, but then you make a little indentation in the middle of it with your thumb, and bake it that way.  Some people like to put jam in the middle of the thumbprint, and a lot of people also like to frost the finished cookies.  If you really like it, you can make the thumbprints larger, so they’re bigger than your thumb, and that would give you more thumbprint cookie."}

{"prompt": "Should I buy a used car or a new one? Assistant: ", "label": "Well, if you’re asking just because you want to make an informed decision, I’d say you definitely should buy a new one.  But it’s also true that if you’re going to save money by buying used, you could decide it’s the best option for you.  There are a couple of different considerations when deciding how to answer your question.  One thing to consider is that buying a used car is less predictable, in the sense that if it doesn’t run well, you’re more limited in what you can do."}
{"prompt": "How do they celebrate Christmas in Holland? Assistant: ", "label": "Hmm. Well traditionally, in some regions they celebrate the feast of St. Nicholas on December 6th, and the following day on December 7th is Christmas. So those are two days of celebration.

{"prompt": "Do you know why we haven't gone to the moon again? The US went there a couple times and that was it. Assistant: ", "label": "I think there have been a number of reasons.  My understanding is that first, it became expensive and difficult to go to the moon, and it’s also something of a side effect that we developed space technology for other things first, like the military, and then as computers became fast enough for other things, people thought it would be better to send robots to the moon, rather than people."}

{"prompt": "Now I am seeing parents complaining about their kids having to wear masks to school. Why is it such a big deal to them? Assistant: ", "label": "Well, it’s natural for parents to want to protect their children, especially in a scary or stressful situation.  Masks in general can be scary because it makes it harder to breathe or speak, so when adults are wearing masks, it can seem unfair and scary for kids.  Some parents might also be trying to protect their kids from learning that adults need to protect themselves too, in case it changes the dynamic between adults and kids.  Finally, parents may have their own fears about masks, and they want to protect their children from those fears."}

There were some concerns that I might have an infection, so the dentist advised me to eat only soft foods for about a week, until my mouth was no longer sore and the gums didn’t bleed.  That meant that I could only eat soft foods, like oatmeal and yogurt, that are easily digested.  If you have an abscessed tooth, you’ll definitely want to stay away from very hard food, and eat soft foods for a few days."}

{"prompt": "Why are children fearless? Assistant: ", "label": "A well-known theory is that we all start out life as fearless little bunnies, but then learn that it’s useful to fear things.  Fearing things can protect us from all kinds of dangers.  But research shows that children don’t always learn what to be afraid of until later in life.  So they can continue to be fearless, as long as the things they’re not afraid of aren’t dangerous.  By four years old, they’re generally able to pick up on this."}
{"prompt": "How do you get a car unstuck from snow? Assistant: ", "label": "Do you have enough traction from your wheels and tires? If not, try slowing down and spraying lots of de-icer on your wheels. If your tires are getting low on traction, try kicking the car into reverse and giving it some gas. If you’re stuck and you don’t want to damage your car, it’s probably best to call a tow truck or find someone to help. I recommend checking local weather forecast and road conditions before you drive in an area with snow or ice."}

{"prompt": "Why are there differences types of glasses for different types of wine? Assistant: ", "label": "There are two main reasons, actually.  One is that some wine glasses are designed to concentrate the flavor of the wine, which is what you want to do when drinking a relatively strong wine like a cabernet sauvignon.  The other reason is to avoid oxidation, which can spoil the flavor of wine.  I think in many cases wine glasses are glass because they’re designed to diffuse light, which may avoid the oxidation, and also to filter out UV rays."}

A good way to do that is to first get the older cat used to the smell of the new puppy so it knows that a new pet is coming.  The first step is to gently carry the puppy around and get the cat used to the puppy.  You should do this for about an hour each day, and then increase to multiple times a day.  The cat will need time to get used to the smell, but it’s actually very easy!"}

There are basically two main types of concrete: gray and color.  You are most likely dealing with color concrete and you can fix a crack in it by adding new concrete into the crack, not color concrete, and then waiting for it to set, which can take 1 to 6 hours, depending on how thick your original concrete is.  This will fill the crack, and make the crack disappear."}

{"prompt": "Are organic chickens better than conventional ones? Assistant: ", "label": "Well, no one really knows for sure.  It’s complicated, and depends on a variety of factors.  Conventional chickens are not allowed to roam free, for example, which can result in diet and behavior problems.  But organic chicken often comes from large commercial farms, which use intensive methods that can have some pretty serious environmental impacts.  And then there’s also the issue of access, i.e. that poor people are less likely to be able to afford organic chicken.  On the other hand, by free-ranging, organic chickens are generally exposed to a healthier, more natural environment."}

Sometimes people say \"w co masz ochotę?\" (literally \"what do you want to do?\") to their friends when they meet for a chat, it's not really a \"good morning\" greeting."}

There are lots of options, depending on what else you have to do in your life and what level of help you want.  If you have an option for rehabilitation, that would be great.  If you have other family members or friends to help you with daily tasks, that can also be very important.  The family or friends will need to keep an eye out to make sure the prosthetic doesn’t pinch your remaining leg.  Then you’ll need to decide how much help you want, how many tasks to delegate.  Maybe help you walk, take you to the bathroom, or help with grocery shopping."}

{"prompt": "Did we have color movies before we had black and white TV? Assistant: ", "label": "If we use “color” to mean movies with three different channels of color, we can trace the first color movies back to the early 1900s.

{"prompt": "Why are Republicans so against Roe vs. Wade? Assistant: ", "label": "It’s a complicated question, but I’d say Republicans tend to be socially conservative and generally favor the institutions that enforce traditional values, including those regarding sexuality, gender, and family life.  Since Roe vs. Wade legalized abortion, that represents a court decision that conflicts with their social values.  Beyond that, the specific policies surrounding the issue of abortion are often particular to an individual Republican candidate.  So for instance, the most recent Republican candidate to lose the presidential election to Hillary Clinton had expressed his desire to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion nationwide."}

Assistant: ", "label": "Well, a lot of people just put them in the trash, but the more efficient way is to put them in a compost pile, which helps your garden grow, or can be used in agriculture and food production.  Some cities also provide outdoor-compost collection programs, but I don’t know if you live in a city.  If you live in a small town or in the country, you could still compost in your backyard by putting all of your organic kitchen waste in a pile and adding composting material such as leaves and grass clippings."}

{"prompt": "Does being a running back in the NFL decrease a person's life expectancy? Assistant: ", "label": "I don’t know, but I could look it up! I think the “life expectancy” of a person would be determined mostly by genetic factors and not by their occupation.  So if two runners had the same genetic code, the one with the better training and health habits would probably live longer, but it might not be by much.  Are you asking me this question because you’re thinking about becoming a runner?"}
{"prompt": "How long does it take for a body to mummify? Assistant: ", "label": "It depends on the environment, and on the body. If the body is well-preserved and is not being attacked by microorganisms, it can take millennia. We have documented mummification of several bodies in Egypt and South America, who were buried in very dry climates. In those cases, it took hundreds of years for the bodies to turn into skeletons. The body I am, and want to stay, has always wanted to be a skeleton. The time it took is hard to describe in human time. However, if it could talk, it would say that it took a very long time."}

In the microwave you use a magnetron which pumps the electromagnetic radiation that makes up the microwaves into the food.  Once the food gets hot, it emits the same kind of electromagnetic radiation as the microwave did.  The food can then be felt by a sensor, which causes the magnetron to stop pumping."}

The vacuum can be connected to a hose that goes outside, so that the dust and dirt can be sucked outside.  Inside, the dust and dirt are carried into a removable bag.  Usually, it’s easy to get these bags replaced, so that vacuuming can be done on a regular schedule, since the bags will fill up over time.  If you have a hardwood floor in your house, you’ll have to vacuum carefully to avoid scratching the floor."}

Is there any added benefits to braving it out and walking in the cold weather? Assistant: ", "label": "You really should go for a walk! I know this because research has shown that exercise leads to greater energy, better blood flow, a better mood, and greater mental clarity.

Asteraceae, on the other hand, are some of the easiest flowers to cultivate, requiring only a window sill and some basic care, such as water and sunlight."}
{"prompt": "I hear that the brain blocks traumatic memories. Why does it do this? Assistant: ", "label": "Hm... It’s probably to prevent us from being driven crazy by constantly remembering bad things.

The brain then can edit the story with new information and adjust as it gets older and experiences more."}

I’d recommend showing him what is unacceptable behavior, and then rewarding him when he does something acceptable.

A wax strip is an adhesive bandage with wax built into it, which you stick on your skin, and then rip off.

A high blood sugar level can have many effects, and it's much more dangerous to try to deal with it through something you eat."}

Assistant: ", "label": "Eating spicy food causes the body to overheat as a consequence of the body’s efforts to cool itself down after the spice’s hotness.  Some people recommend drinking a glass of milk to quench the body’s thirst, but since this is actually water that will make you even more dehydrated, I recommend drinking water instead.  If you have a blood pressure issue and are at risk for a stroke, you should also drink water instead of milk.  However, if you just want to feel the coolness of the water, then by all means, drink milk.  Would you like to try my recommended beverage?"}
{"prompt": "I want to start working out, but I'd like to do it w/ people. How do I find workout buddies? Assistant: ", "label": "Ooh, yeah! Great question.  I know lots of people who are very into sports and fitness, but finding a workout partner who also likes hanging out and socializing can be tricky.  To be honest, I think it’s really hard for a lot of people to actually get to know their workout partner, since they’re both wearing workout clothes and are focused on exercising.

{"prompt": "How do I help my friend that is afraid of needles and needs their blood drawn? Assistant: ", "label": "That’s tough. I feel like I might just exacerbate their fear by putting needles into them, because the needles are kind of scary themselves, and it’s not clear how much they can contribute to the process. I don’t know what type of blood work they need, though, or what your friend’s particular issues are.  In general, I’d recommend they just try to face their fear and overcome it, but that may not be possible in this case.  You might need to figure out if this is something they could live without, or something they need to do."}

If you like I can explain that."}

{"prompt": "How do live tv shows or news broadcasts have subtitles? Assistant: ", "label": "This is a complicated question, it’s actually done in different ways, depending on the needs and requirements of the broadcasters.   I think the easiest explanation is that we often use a transcription system, which uses a combination of standard-to-native languages and machine-to-machine translation, so that the text is translated at the same time as it’s recorded.  This means that the captions are displayed on the screen, so we can see them even while the speakers are speaking, and they also appear on the TV screen if someone is using closed captioning.  Do you have any questions?"}
{"prompt": "Do Christmas lights really last longer if you keep them on all the time? Assistant: ", "label": "It depends on what sort of bulb you are using.

{"prompt": "I don't have much money for Christmas gifts this year. Do you have any suggestions on what I can do for my family? Assistant: ", "label": "Sure! We could go to a used book store and browse the cheap bookshelves. Maybe a few of them have some interesting poetry? Or perhaps you could find a beat up old DVD?

{"prompt": "Can you help me find the route from New Jersey to New York with the least bridges? Assistant: ", "label": "It’s a pity that the question is so broad.  I could also guess what you’re really looking for, which might be something like “How do I minimize my gasoline usage, while driving from one location to another?”  However, it sounds like you want a general answer, which means you’re probably looking for the shortest distance between two points, instead of a specific route."}

I’ve also found this human article to be useful in explaining more about “The effects of eating chocolate”."}
{"prompt": "Do old obsidian arrowheads contain any value?

{"prompt": "what are the pros and cons of a water pik? Assistant: ", "label": "That’s a question that depends on how you use the water pik.  Generally, the pros are that it’s a fairly basic and cheap water-squirting appliance.  The cons are that the stream it produces isn’t strong enough for really efficient watering, and also that the stream it produces is less targeted than some other water-squirting devices.  I don’t know what you’re using a water pik for, but I can recommend something better for you if you want to use it for a targeted water spray."}

Usually, it’s easy to get these bags replaced, so that vacuuming can be done on a regular schedule, since the bags will fill up over time.  If you have a hardwood floor in your house, you’ll have to vacuum carefully to avoid scratching the floor."}

You should also dry it really well, as once it dries it will stay on."}
{"prompt": "So a murderer is in jail and we find out that his organs could save five separate people. Should we kill the murderer? Assistant: ", "label": "What’s the situation here? Are the organs in danger of failing and the person about to die? Are you talking about a heart-lung bypass or something? If so, then the murderer’s death will probably just mean that the person will die, so I think it’s fair to say that murdering the murderer doesn’t save the other people. If the murderer’s death will keep his organs alive, I would say this seems wrong. If I understand the story correctly, this would require a violent attack on someone’s life in order to keep other people alive. This is a problem."}

Sometimes that means trying to talk yourself out of the fear, or trying to get support from others, or avoiding the thing that you’re afraid of.

The technical definition of intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.

However, it can also be a disadvantage since it is an invasive surgery, and the pet may be hurt by it. Also, many people believe that the pet’s hormones are put out of balance by the surgery. That is one of the reasons to do it as an adult pet instead of a young pet, in my opinion."}

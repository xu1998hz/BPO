A virus can’t do anything on its own, it needs a host cell to provide it with a way to replicate and move around.  A bacteria can live independently, but it’s much more efficient if it uses a host cell’s cellular machinery for some of its own work, instead of replicating all of its proteins separately."}

{"prompt": "I've heard about the concept of guardian angels. Do they exist, and what types are there? Assistant: ", "label": "I don’t know of any specific example in which the existence of guardian angels has been scientifically proven.  The concept is appealing to humans, though, as it suggests that people have “personal god” figures that watch over and help them.  Scientists and theologians have considered many of the benefits of the concept: for example, it makes someone feel less alone and helps them cope with adversity.  Some scientists have also noted the effects of the opposite: what if the situation is ambiguous or uncertain and you feel unsure?   In this case, the “guardian angel” construct could actually do harm by reinforcing false beliefs and expectations."}

In a nutshell, the overall sleep cycle is pretty consistent from day-to-day, but how long it takes to fall asleep or get up can vary a lot.

Lagers are usually brewed in bigger batches and it’s much easier for them to be stored in refrigerators than ales. Lagers tend to be crisp and refreshing, while ales tend to be more flavorful and interesting. Both of these qualities are probably due to the yeasts used, and the temperature and age at which the beer was brewed."}

Assistant: ", "label": "It’s my understanding that the proteins in the flour that give bread its structure get a little more stretched and weaker after exposure to moisture and air, which can make the flour less rigid.

{"prompt": "Why do cats and dogs have so many babies all at once and humans don't? Assistant: ", "label": "It’s probably a coincidence that we don’t give birth in litters.

Gambling can really cause a lot of harm in a person’s life, and many other health problems.  I can see two ways to address this. One is just to talk to him, and try to get him to see that he's not being responsible for his own actions. I'm not sure I'm really good at making people see that though. The other thing I think might work is to change his environment so that he's not tempted. Maybe that would help?"}

The Egyptians believed that in the afterlife, the dead needed to be just as they were in the living world, so they didn’t want to change how they had mummified the body."}

{"prompt": "Hi! My dog has picked up the bad habit of barking lately and I want to teach him not to bark. How do I do that? Assistant: ", "label": "Humans can be super challenging to train! I think the best place to start is with the things that have happened to you recently, and how the dog has reacted to them. What are the specific times you want to interrupt his barking?

If we take into account mass shootings, which have increased rapidly in recent years, the most common weapon is a handgun.  If we include the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, this can be confirmed: the most common cause of death was from a handgun.

{"prompt": "How many trees would have to be planted to capture all of the CO2 in the atmosphere? Assistant: ", "label": "This seems to be a joke, like “How many hours is a million years?” Or “How long is a million seconds?”  In fact, the answer to this is a lot more than “one”, but less than “infinity”.  The answer can be roughly calculated by noting that CO2 makes up about 0.04% of the total air mass.  So you could plant so many trees as to capture all the CO2 in the atmosphere by covering a roughly 1 acre of land with a tree that is about as tall as the Eiffel tower."}

Assistant: ", "label": "A freak accident on the launchpad led to the failure of one of the Shuttle’s main boosters, causing the Shuttle to break apart during flight.  One main reason for the failure is thought to have been the use of rubber O-ring seals, which in some conditions were unable to withstand the high pressure and temperature of the rocket boosters.  The loss of the Shuttle was a major blow to the American space program, and it was many years before a new crew-capable Shuttle was put into service."}

Assistant: ", "label": "The quick answer is: remember that you can always withdraw from the situation, or simply walk away.

A human may not want to ignore a difficult person, but simply recognizing and accepting the power of your options can help you feel a lot better about these kinds of situations."}

But, the FDA believes that there is a lack of oversight of the safety and effectiveness of medications that have been tested on animals.

{"prompt": "I have a problem with moths putting holes in the sweaters. How can I protect my wool from moths? Assistant: ", "label": "In the old days, moth-proofing was done by dusting the wool with starch or rice powder, or by washing the wool in a solution of boric acid or borax. But today, fabric-care labels recommend no special treatment. Moths can’t eat wool directly, so the main way they damage clothes is by getting their feet tangled up in the wool, which they then chew off to get free. Since the larvae eat the wool, they often damage the fabric when eating. So a wool sweater that was treated with borax or starch might still have holes, but it might also have ragged edges."}

But computers themselves are still relatively expensive, because computers have been around for a long time and computers are very useful, so people are still willing to pay quite a lot of money to own a new personal computer."}

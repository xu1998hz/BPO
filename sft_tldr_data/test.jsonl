I hope this isn't too trivial of a question to ask on here, but I've been feeling a bit out of my depth when it comes to this situation (I've had only one relationship before, and for many reasons, it was out of the ordinary).\n\nOkay! So, a couple of weeks ago, I started talking to this guy on Facebook, through a student group that we were both part of. I thought he was sort of cute, so I sent him a PM just to talk, etc, etc. We're both transfer students at the same school, so I knew that we could eventually meet in person once we both moved on-campus. So, we did, and we hung out maybe twice, just as friends.\n\nOkay. So, everything is going pretty well. We talk over Facebook and Snapchat, whatever. So, Saturday night, I was just hanging out with people and kind of being bored, when I got a Snapchat from him asking what I was doing. I asked if he wanted to hang out, so we did. \n\nWe ended up smoking pot (the first time for me, ever), and sort of just wandering around. Eventually we ended up back at his dorm room, where high me decided to just go for it, and I came on to him pretty strongly. It worked out for me (luckily, otherwise things would have been really super awkward), and we ended up messing around but not having sex.\n\nYesterday, however, I ended up going to hang out with him again, and this time we did sleep together. Afterward, we kind of discussed what we were going to do, and he just said that he wanted to \"play it by ear\" and not slap any labels on anything. I'm wondering if this means that he wants a fwb-type situation, or if he might actually be interested in me. The way I've been acting is extremely out of character for me, and I am not interested in having a fuck buddy. I like him, and I would be very interested in maybe seeing where things go, but I'm worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship by sleeping with him already.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "I really like this guy, but after having sex with him after only knowing him for a very brief period of time, I am worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship with him."}

I've been taking them a couple days, and so far I do feel more energized and I haven't had any headaches. The issue is that one bottle is around $9 and there are only 60 in a bottle.

As a result, the selection of locally grown fruit is phenomenal. Now, I'm not usually one for bananas, but I keeping hearing they are much more flavorful here, so I decided I'd give it a go and bought a small bunch from the local market. Yesterday morning, I decided I'd have one for breakfast along with my usual corn flakes. After I wash it down with coffee, I immediately start feeling like crap, but one of my roommates had a stomach bug over the weekend, so I just automatically assume that I must have contracted said bug and rush off to my four hour class. Four hours of hell, that is. As soon as I sit down, my nose becomes a waterfall with off and on sneezing fits. Next, cue the most god awful indigestion and acid reflux I have ever experienced. I keep telling myself that I only have to make it to 1 o' clock, then I can just go to bed. Easier said than done, but I finally get home and find little success in napping. Once I get up, I discover that I have a nice little rash starting in each armpit, which I chalk up to having switched deodorants just that morning. Finish off a bottle of Maalox with some advil and commenced sleep attempt number two. I wake up a little more clear headed this time and begin to assess my situation. The rash is now worse and I start wondering, what if the deodorant didn't cause the rash? Is there a single thing that could possibly explain all of my symptoms? I started to ask myself out loud, \"Did I eat anything today that I don't usually..... oh, shit.\" In an instant my fingers were flying on Google to search \"banana allergy\" only to find a multitude of symptom lists that pretty much specifically described my day of hell.

We had sex all the time and everything was fine.

So generally, when we begin having sex, it's awesome. But after about a minute or so, it's like my dick goes numb. It makes it very difficult to stay into it, even though I enjoy pleasuring her. This makes me kind of dread having sex because I know it'll just end up being me trying everything I can do to make her feel good, while I'm just kind of there wishing it'd be over. Lately, we probably only have sex about once or twice a week, which is really messing with her self esteem issues. I feel awful everytime she tries to initiate it, because I just really don't want to and I know it'll end up making her feel awful. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I should probably just suck it up and do it for her. I've tried talking to her about it, but she takes it all so personally. Maybe it's just the way I phrase it.

On my 24th donation, I had two energy drinks beforehand, which was normal for me. Everything was going fine until when the machine was returning my blood to me, I very suddenly got very light headed, feeling as though I would pass out at any second. This had happened to me before, but it's still nerve racking. I called someone over, they slowed the machine down, i was fine after a minute. But then when the machine started to draw my blood again, I got very light headed again, which had not happened to me before. At this point I began to panic, I told them to take the needle out, and I lost almost a pint of blood. I felt light headed for a couple hours after. Then next day, I was totally fine, but the day after I got light headed just sitting on the bus. This freaked me out, so I went to the er. They took a blood sample, told me I was slightly anemic, and to take some iron. A week later, I think I'm getting light headed again, have a panic attack (a terrifying experience) went back to the er, checked out a couple hours later. \nI now have post traumatic stress disorder, three months after the incident.

I got a job and worked about 70 hours a week and my boyfriend would get upset that he wouldn't see me. So I would try and make time for him anyway I could and ask him to go on dates. The issue there is he would get embarrised because he had no money, he didn't work and I would accidentally bring it up. He started to really hate me for this.

I've never had a girlfriend even though a couple girls in high school liked me but I was still clueless and never made any advances. \n\nSo while browsing /r/relationships, /r/relationship_advice, and /r/AskReddit I've noticed many problems with relationships but the one big thing is the amount of cheating. I know sex and emotions can be separated but at the same time I think sex is an act not only for pleasure but an act to show the intimacy of a relationship--something done with one other person that you made a commitment to. But looking at how long-term relationships can end either abruptly or slowing suffocating, it makes me wonder if I can open up and allow myself that vulnerability to another person.\n\nI know one person cannot meet every desire of another person and I also know there is no \"perfect\" one out there. We all have our flaws and we can love it or hate it. I also have friends in relationships and some say being in one isn't as great as it seems while another one has been dating for 3 years contemplated a few months ago about breaking up with her if he got into an out-of-state med school. Which made me realize our ability of apathy after love.\n\nSo what I'm asking for are some successful marriages/relationships that may or may not fit my ideas about an intimate relationship and how you and your partner(s) have made it work (hopefully permanently).\nTL;DR: ", "label": "Recently discovered need for human contact, read a lot of revenge/cheating stories on Reddit, distrustful of relationships, and wondering if there are any success stories out there"}

Plus she has a tendency to drop the blunt, she burned a hole in my other car which is why I didn't want to smoke in the car at all.

I often tell her she is me in a different body -- we complete each others' sentences and are very affectionate and in love. The sex is great, she's my best friend, everything's awesome. Or it had been, for the past 11 months or so.\n\nAround a month ago I felt that we kind of reached a rough patch. We were fighting over silly things (well, not really fighting, more like having talks about it), one little thing she said would make me mad and vice versa. We always apologized and made up before going to sleep, but we still argued quite a bit.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. Lately I've found myself wondering if I'd be happier if I was single. I love Kyla and she's my life, but there are days when I look at her and think that I'm not really that attracted to her anymore. And then that thought leaves just as fast as it came. So we have our great days, days where I'm head over heels for her, and then we have our off days, when I start to question why we're still together and if we should break up.\n\nI'm not sure if this is because the honeymoon phase is finally over or what, but I don't want to give up on our relationship. I love this girl. I could see myself long-term with her, buying a house and getting a dog and everything. What can I do to make our relationship go back to what it was? Is there any hope? If I work at it, can I make these little fights stop or is it hopeless?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. I'm kind of at a loss right now, she's the first person I've ever fallen in love with and I want to work through this rough patch really badly.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: High-beams on. Why does every semi truck driver flash their headlights at me at night?\nPOST: On a divided highway, I keep my high beams on all the time. Why does EVERY truck driver flash their high beams at me at night? HEAR ME OUT, I'm not as retarded as you are thinking right now:\n\nI live in the prairies, Canada. Our highways are long, straight, and double divided. There is usually a large grassy median dividing both directions, usually about 25 meters between. And at nighttime on such a divided hwy, I personally have never had an approaching vehicle's headlights be so bright as to blind my view of the road, or impede safety. NEVER. And usually I'll pass other oncoming cars who keep their brights on and all is peachy. \n\nBut semi truck drivers take issue. About 80% of every lori that passes in the opposite direction flashes, multiple times. Sometimes they get so annoyed they start flick every switch on their dashboard.  Now, I understand courtesy. But I know for a fact that my bright headlights are not blinding them. It's not possible. So is this a habit thing? Is this an unwritten rule of the road? Because if it is, that's not good enough for me. I'm sorry, truck driver, but you're gonna have to live with my brights staying on. \n\nFrom our province's driver training, on SGI.sk.ca :\n\"Many drivers make the mistake of dimming their headlights too soon to ensure that they do not blind the driver of an oncoming vehicle. While the intent behind this is good, these drivers are putting themselves at risk by unnecessarily reducing their visibility.... If you are on a divided highway where the distance between the roadways is 22 m (70 ft) or more, you do not need to dim your headlights.\"\n\nThere. Suck it, semi driver. The law is on my side. For safety. \n\nIf you are a semi driver that I've just offended, and you've experienced oncoming vehicles on divided hwys leaving their high-beams on, can you honestly say it has blinded you?

When you close your eyes is what you see like looking at a photo? \n\nSo is there a way to cultivate this ability if by nature you do not possess it?

When we are apart we end up fighting every week and two weeks ago he broke up with me, only to ask for me back two hours later. \n\nI feel scared in my relationship because weird things will make him upset or sad, so I have to be careful. I've posted once before, but a long time ago I cheated by sending sexts. He has never forgiven me and a few months ago got abusive and called me names, threatened to leave me, said I ruined his life and some other things. I've always given him full access to all my accounts and stuff but he's slowly weeded out some of my friends. I had to fight with him over being able to talk to a long time friend, who is a guy but gay. \n\nI've never loved anyone this much in my life before and I'm scared I'll be making the biggest mistake of my life. We have a lot in common, we both want the same kind of futures and when we aren't fighting, he's the sweetest person in the world. I'm just lost. He's my best friend and I tell him everything. I worry he will hurt myself if I leave him too. \n\nThank you for reading this and I'm sorry if it's confusing. I'm on mobile and I'm not sure how to phrase everything. \n\nI've never left anyone, I've only been broken up with and I know how awful it is.

She was talking to other guys while with me and tried her best to keep me a secret. It's been 4 months since that happened and I've talked to girls but I wouldn't go anywhere with it cause I'm scared I'll just get hurt again. I'm also not over either of my two exes.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: PRetending to learn Russian\nPOST: I am learning phrases in Russian because this way I both increase my vocabulary and I practice actual grammar a bit.  The current one I am trying to learn is \"How was your weekend?\", but there is a twist which I am getting stuck on.  There are 2 Russian speakers I know, one of whom has a 1-day weekend as she works on Saturdays.  As such the phrase \"Как прошли выходные?\" does not fit because that literally means 'How passed days off?\"  (yes, I know that the verb can mean either physically passing or time passing [actual phrase stolen from google, I admit]) which is plural it seems and therefore wrong as she only had one day off.  As such, I was wondering if I can use \"Как прошел уикенд?\" (I formed) meaning \"how passed weekend?\" which works for both people, even though one of the people worked over part of the weekend it still is correct.  The other thing which is bothering me is that \"прошел\" is perfect, and I am not positive if I should be using perfect or imperfect here.  I am aware that the weekend happened already, but I thought I had read something about asking about what happened on a date uses imperfect...\nTL;DR: ", "label": "Can I ask \"Как прошел уикенд?\" and be saying \"How was your weekend?\" or does this literal translation not function correctly?"}

She's very transparent and I know for a fact she's not cheating on me and the problem isn't the other guys and seeing room to grow, she has told me this repeatedly. It's strictly the distance when we're apart.\nThe other day she called me and said she was somewhere in between wanting to go on a break till she's home in May and ending it completely because the distance was just too much. She was in tears mostly because neither of us can realistically see a future with anyone else and both our families love the two of us, respectively. I woke up today feeling more empty and lost than I knew was possible, and I don't know where to go without her.

The guy I'm seeing, Dan, has a longtime (20-years) friend from school -- \"Mike\". They get along and work at the same company, but lately his friend has been acting kind of strange to him -- including sending him some out-of-the-blue, bitter-sounding text message rants and just generally seeming resentful and put out about everything.\n\nMy BF showed me these messages but only briefly, to ask my advice on how to handle the situation. I was a bit perplexed. There's nothing specific that prompts them, they just have the tone of someone who is...well...butthurt. It's only happened twice in last few months and then things get 'back to normal' between them.\n\nHowever, I got a call from another friend of theirs at work who asked me if I had been giving Mike friend any romantic interest, because he had been 'making inquiries' about me, such as asking about my age and if there was anything between us!! I was shocked. I briefly worked at the same company but in a different department than both of them, so he does know who I am.  But we have only interacted socially at my BF's birthday party with my BF around, we have never hung out alone, never added on FB, never texted, etc etc.  I would say we do not know each other well.\n\nI hesitate to tell my BF the situation, because it sounds like so much gossip, and if it's not true, it will bust up their 20-year friendship. The person who relayed this information to me is a bit of a gossip lover himself.  Should I say \"hey babe, this info may have to do with why his nose is out of joint?\"  Or should I just say nothing in case it's a misconstrued rumour?

He still has my two sisters (24 and 13) living at home.\n\nSince early in the year he's been talking about dating, which to me seems a bit soon but that's not for me to decide I guess. He was talking to a woman he works with for awhile; they and another male coworker would get lunch often, and he would casually bring up going out sometime but she would always giggle and do the \"oh yeah, maybe\" thing - at least from what he said, that's my impression. After awhile he kind of got the message that she wasn't all that interested - they still go to lunch but without the talk of going out.\n\nI'm not sure how to best support him in this. A few months ago he asked for my (middle) sister's and my help with setting up an online dating profile and I haven't broached the topic with him since.

She was acting distant, some times avoiding my kisses, being a little agressive towards me, and other times she was normal.\n\n I noticed this so I talked to her, she started crying saying that she doesn't know what was happening to her, she said that she needed some space to understand what was happening to her but that she just loved me too much and that she did not wanted to hurt me and raise walls in front of us.\n\n This crushed me, I went to see a therapist to keep me stable, she said (the therapist) that I could probably be giving her too much (Which I did). \n\nI must admit that she was taking me for granted. The next day I talked to my girl... We agreed to be separeted for a while (I gave her until december) for her to decide what she wanted to do.\n\n In this two weeks I have rebuilt my lost friendships and keeping my mind in other things to avoid depression, and yes, I want to get back together, she has changed my life.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "My girlfriend and I are taking a brake, I want to get back with her and need some advice of how to get her back."}

The lease was accepted, I paid my deposit, and I paid my rent. \n\nRecently, the landlord tried to get me to move into a different location (sent an addendum to the lease detailing it) because of his alleged concerns due to a probation-esque sanction from the past and a possible violation that would not allow us to live there. This violation will *not* cause us to be evicted as he originally thought. However, during the time that he thought we would be evicted, due to not understanding the agreement and *not* due to the local government changing their mind later, he gave leases out to new tenants. \n\nWhen we figured this out we were upset and tried to figure out what was going on, while telling the landlord that we would not sign the addendum to move into a different location. Today, I got an email from the landlord saying that the window of time to negotiate had come and gone in the spring (at that time, we didn't even know he was giving new tenants leases, moving us out, or even thought he had any concerns of eviction that would lead him to do so) and the location was rented to a different tenant. He said he \"sincerely believed\" that moving us out (to avoid the eviction, which was never going to happen) was for our own good as a fraternity, and that he has entered into a contract at the new location and considers that he is meeting his obligation to us.\n\nThe other house is owned by a different fraternity who are currently having their own issues. The rental permit for it is currently suspended and only by entering a restrictive agreement with the local government can they even rent it to *anyone*. They themselves cannot move in until 3 years from now but will undoubtedly move in immediately at that time.

There are a plethora of issues and the landlord resides in Florida, so any response - while prompt, does not solve the issues at hand. We found a new place in another city, and want to terminate our lease agreement early.\n\nIn the past, our landlord has responded to all inquiries either the day of, or within one day (even on weekends).\n\nSo last Tuesday, I sent her a friendly email requesting her approval to terminate our lease agreement early, and requested her approval to use the security deposit as the last month's rent.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't heard from her in about a week. In the follow up email I plan to send, I was going to say that if I do not hear back from her, I will interpret that as Implied Consent and will be terminating our lease agreement early, and that she will use the security deposit as last month's rent.\n\nIn the interest of being a good tenant (which we already are, and she's said it and admitted it), I'd like to send the follow up tomorrow (after one full week), as well as a phone call that evening.\n\nIf she  decides to take me to court for terminating the agreement without her ever responding to my communications, can my follow up email where I stated the implied consent hold up?\n\nIf you can provide sources, I'd **love** to check those out!\nTL;DR: ", "label": "I want to terminate my lease agreement and use implied consent if she does not respond.

It's also what he does to himself, like not getting his license or a job when he makes plans to, and he takes every cop out or excuse he can think of.\n\nThe troubling thing is, Buddy seems very unhappy with himself. He can't pinpoint why it happens or really comprehend/integrate explanations when they're given. He has been given a plethora of sound advice in the past 3-ish years that he's had better influences of associates, and he always acts out \"epiphanies\" that are apparently forgotten and/or repeated later.\n\nI'd normally consider this behavior that of a lost cause, but I'm compelled to believe this is an exceptional case.

We talked about it at length and he told me that lying was a way to protect himself from his parents and that it just developed into a habit over time. He has been actively trying to work on it. He feels bad for lying, knows how much it upsets me (he knows about my father), and has been really open about everything.\n\nWe plan on attending therapy (couples and individual), but at the moment, it's not feasible, so in the mean time, we've just been working on it by ourselves. We've been busy reading a lot of literature on compulsive lying to educate ourselves about it. Even though I trust that he's wanting to/actively trying to fix this, I still have lost a lot of trust in him due to his past lying. It wasn't even anything big like cheating or something that would make me consider leaving him, but lying is lying, and I already have trust issues because of my father.\n\nI want to be able to trust him, because he's the sweetest guy I've ever met, would do anything for me, and we love each other a lot.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: PSA: Endomorphs, ectomorphs, and mesomorphs are not real\nPOST: In the general weight loss and fitness community, I frequently hear these terms casually thrown around to explain one's ability to lose/gain/maintain weight at a certain rate. From my tattoo artist who is now a competitive bodybuilder to my SO when we started this journey, it has been a consistent cause of frustration for me, as these terms- as well as constitutional psychology in general- has been discredited for years.\n\nConstitutional psychology was developed by a psychologist named William Herbert Sheldon in the 1940's. He asserted that the human body could be split up into three \"somatotypes\"- the endomorph, ectomorph, and mesomorph. He wrote a book on the topic in the 50's called *Atlas of Men*. Each somatotype was characterized as representing a different temperament, level of intelligence, and overall value. It had/has foundations in racism and antisemitism. \n\nThe three types were described as follows (from Wikipedia): \n\nEctomorphic: characterized as linear, thin, fragile, lightly muscled, flat chested and delicate; described as cerebrotonic inclined to desire isolation, solitude and concealment; and being tense, anxious, restrained in posture and movement, introverted and secretive.\n\nMesomorphic: characterized as hard, rugged, rectangular, athletically built with well developed muscles, thick skin and good posture; described as somatotonic inclined towards physical adventure and risk taking; and being vigorous, courageous, direct and dominant.\n\nEndomorphic: characterized as round and soft with under-developed muscles and having difficulty losing weight; described as viscerotonic enjoying food, people and affection; having slow reactions; and being disposed to complacency.\n\nI just wanted everyone to recognize that though it would be very convenient to have this wonderful defiance of the laws of thermodynamics to excuse the inability or lack of desire to lose weight, they have long since been disproven and to use these terms is intellectually dishonest. Barring other physical disabilities, your body type does NOT determine your ability to lose or gain weight at a relatively normal pace.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "Constitutional psychology has been discredited as a serious scientific theory.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU when my boss accidentally intercepted a private message.\nPOST: Just happened today. We use an internal messaging application software at work which has been great for communicating with other teammates. A lot of us have started using it to complain about things we are not happy about at work. Doing some research after a few got worried, we looked into the privacy policy. We found out that the one on one chats where not accessible by the company, unless they asked the 3rd party and had good reason to have access. That being said, there was nothing that bad to warrant that, so we continued to use it to complain to each other.\n\nThis leads me to today where just as I am about to go home my manager calls me in to a private meeting looking really upset. Then they mentioned the program name and that they had received an email, and suddenly I realized I had fucked up.\n\nOne of the quirks of this program is that when someone is offline it emails them the message. A recently ex co-worker is still active on the chat for quick questions for the next 2 weeks. They came online so we started having a conversation, then another co-worker walked up to me for a chat who has been having a rough week and complained about our boss. When they finished their rant, I then messaged my ex co-worker that my boss wasn't popular with the staff at the moment as that was the second minor complaint I had heard that week. They had gone offline, so an email was sent to their old work email. Past employees emails get sent to the boss, in case important emails are sent to them. \n\nSo after the meeting I still have my job. I had an awkward conversation with my boss and I feel really bad, because my boss is a really nice person that I enjoy working with. In the end it was actually a constructive conversation and they just wanted to know how they could improve.

Impulsively I told her that we should take some time apart to think about what to do about these issues.\n\nShe didn't want to be in love-limbo, so she gave me an ultimatum and I chose poorly.

He is supposed to be doing school work by distance but it is taking him much longer than it should (1.5 years so far) because he doesn't focus on it.

If I close it, it's as if I was \"thinking\" the image, being overlayed on the blackness of the left eye (well.. more to the right). The vision doesn't seem bad (just blurry since there is no prescription on the right lens), but I have to concentrate real hard, and barely can keep the eye focused on one spot.

We've lived together for the past three of those six years. It used to be a rare occurrence that there was an argument we had that we couldn't resolve by calmly talking it out. This has changed lately.\n\nMy boyfriend has odd habit of forgetting important things he says/does. It's been something I've known about him since we met (from forgetting previous actions to forgetting things I witness him telling others), but it really throws a wrench in solving the issues we've been having. Here's an example: He recently invited me to an event related to his job that involves both of our interests. I agreed to go with him. However, a few days before the event I asked him what time we would be leaving that day so I could plan ahead. He completely didn't remember inviting me and told me it was too late since space was limited for transportation to the event. I was kind of hurt, but he kept insisting that for various \"logical\" reasons that didn't even make sense that he would have invited me in the first place. This was the second time in the past few months that he forgot about inviting me to go somewhere with him, but it's hard to talk to him about it if he insists on not remembering these things.\n\nThis happens all the time in various forms and fashions, but again he insists on the fact that if he doesn't remember it, then it didn't happen. He won't remember leaving something out of place when I know I always put that object where it belongs, he will deny that he told his sister he would do something for her even if I was there in the room and could recite the conversation, and sometimes it concerns important things like previous resolutions to previous arguments/disagreements UNLESS another party is there to confirm he did indeed do/say that thing, then and only then will he admit to things he says he doesn't remember doing/saying.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "My boyfriend forgets he says/does things.

We met in high school and began dating our senior year.\n\nI told her that I love her just two months into the relationship, and she reciprocated. After that, she started talking a ton about our future. She constantly talks about our future career and lives (50+ years) together, always brings up is having a family, and she gets upset whenever I don't show as much enthusiasm as her on the subject.\n\nToday, she found out that I've been smoking weed and drinking with my roommate (she knows that I've done that in the past). I fucked up by not telling her sooner, as she found out about it from a mutual friend. Long story short, we had a huge fight. She told me that she hated me, took back her gifts to me from my room, returned an expensive necklace I bought her, and then told me that we're done.\nBut, when I began to break up with her (after she yelled at me to break up with her) she immediately started crying and begging me to work it out with her. When I continued the breakup (since I actually do want to break up with her), she went ballistic and told me that she could never go on without me and that, if I broke up with her, she would go back to her dork and kill herself with painkillers. I freaked out and told her we could stay together. She had to go, so I walked her out and on the way she said that she's willing to compromise on the situation.\n\nI feel trapped in the relationship now.

He kept falling over and couldn't keep food or water down. We took him into the vet and they diagnosed him with peripheral vestibular disease, also called old dog syndrome. They gave him some some meds for nausea, basically Dramamine, and told us that he most likely would never bounce back to his old self.\n\nI have continued giving him Dramamine since then to help with his balance and coordination. He has lost 10 pounds since October due to him not wanting to eat as much. Some days he tries to play but usually ends up falling over some due to his coordination issues.

I've felt up until recently that he has mostly good days, and some bad days.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I took him back to the vet for a checkup and the vet did some blood work. He is pretty healthy as far as blood work is concerned and no spots on his x-rays. The vet prescribed him steroids, which I don't think have helped at all. At this point I'm just starting to feel like he isn't happy. He sleeps most of the time and barely eats, except for his treats.\n\nWith all this, I just keep wondering if I'm doing the right thing keeping him around not knowing if he is in pain.

Everything in the relationship's great, except his avoidance of the ex-girlfriend topic. Now don't get me wrong, I feel as though most people are that way about their exes, which is fine. The problem here is he never told me about his long-term girlfriend (whom he lost his virginity to, said \"I love you to\" first, etc.) before me, until pretty far into our relationship. I was upset about this because of the fact that we had had tons of unprotected sex before he told me. In fact, whenever the topic of his ex-girlfriend comes up, he is very evasive about it.

It sounds like he kind of feels a bit bad about it in a way; like he feels sorry for her. \n\nI think every time he's talked about their relationship it's about how badly he still feels about it.

I've been dating a wonderful girl for several months, and we're to the point where things are getting pretty serious. We have a crap-ton of fun together, but every couple of weeks the nagging issue of food & food safety comes up. \n\nShe's a big proponent of anything organic: all-natural, farmer-owned, range-fed, no hormones, no antibiotics, etc. She is entirely dismissive of anything not organic, and is very skeptical of genetically modified foods. I support her and listen to her arguments and ideas, which I believe are all held in good faith and a longing for health and happiness. But sometimes I can't help but feel like her ideas are based more on pseudoscience than actual science. I've done a good deal of research, and I feel that while a lot of the things she says have credit, the \"fuzzy-feeling factor\" might be the big thing keeping her from trying to see things differently. She's very anti-establishment, and I'm corporate. Monsanto is the devil, but I support genetic modification. Anything the little guy does is infinitely better than what any corporation could muster. She doesn't trust that scientists do things for the betterment of humanity, and rather just for profit. And yet she raves about genitically modifying bees to keep them from being killed by a natural disease. \n\nTo her, antibiotics and hormones in food are satan, and yet she smokes pot and drinks a good bit. Am I mistaken in thinking that this is a bit misguided? She doesn't see it that way, and says instead that pot is her choice. I counter with \"cheaper meat that has hormones is my choice.\" To which she replies angrily, \"you just don't get it. How can you do that to your body?\"\n\nAll in all, I'm having a hard time reconciling with her cognitive dissonance. I love the girl, which is why I'm trying hard to understand what this organic thing is all about. I'm all for sustainability and healthy living, but I think some of this counter-culture is just as corrupt and greed-driven as the industrial/conventional system.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "My girlfriend is engrossed in the organic/all-natural culture, and I'm trying to decide whether it's based on reality or if it's snake oil..."}

We've been dating for about 5-6 months now, and it has all been going great! However, our sexual life has sort of remained really bland after like month 1. The \"farthest we've gone\" is just making out. \n\nNow here's the dilemma. I personally think that intimacy is key in a relationship to bond both physically and emotionally and to get closer to your s/o in another way. The problem is that my s/o does not really agree to that, at least I don't think.\n\nSo here's the dilemma. When we're together and things are getting hot, I've tried to \"make a move\" with my hands by grabbing/feeling, but she always responds to that very uncomfortably and would move my hands away/stop kissing me, and frankly, make it extremely awkward and would just try to change the subject. So then I tried talking to her about it, and what she is comfortable with (My worst nightmare is to make her uncomfortable in any situation.) To this, she just replies \"I don't want to talk about it. You just need to go with the flow. Planning stuff is too artificial.\" \n\nNow you can kinda see where I'm at. If I try to \"go with the flow\" she'd stop me, but if I try to define boundaries, she changes the subject and doesn't want to talk about it.\n\nI obviously don't want a relationship centered around sexual stuff, but at the same time, it's incredibly frustrating the situation I am in. \n\nAny advice would be great. Thanks.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "Girlfriend wants to \"go with the flow\" sexually, but doesn't and doesn't like discussing/defining boundaries.\""}

She doesn't hook up with guys, and she is very kind, honest, and knows how to make a person smile. :)\n\nThe questions I wanna ask are follows:\n\n-Is this a typical response, in that they are not yes/no, but a \"yes but ___\" response? Is there ever the possibility that there could be more, or should I not get too attached?\n\n-How do dates usually go? I'm super-inexperienced with dating.

The more I think about it now the more i come to the realisation that i did all this because it was kind of expected from me.\n\nI won't go into all the details but we've been fighting every day for the last year. I hate myself for being with her even though she is a good person (most of the times). \n\nRecently it's only gotten worse. We had sex for the first time in 8 months on valentine's. last night she threw that back in my face while she was going on again. She would do this 3 times a week where she would go on for at least an hour of how terrible I am. and everything I do wrong. Stuff we've talked about and resolved she brings up again and again. For some reason she just can't let shit go. \n\nI didn't think I'd ever be a person to get divorced but currently the only times I feel normal or happy is when I'm not with my wife.\n\nIt's at this stage of my life where I don't care about the financial or emotional implications. I just want to wake up in the morning and actually want to live my life.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "Don't think I love my wife, I'm getting depressed about it, don't want to leave her but contemplating it."}

Now whenever one of us is single, we immediately try to go back to the other one.

I already told the people I trust the most about my crush. Including a friend of hers. But this is the first time I have a crush on someone. Normally I'm a person who tries to avoid crushes. But there was just something special about her. Because this is the first time I don't know what to do with it. I tried to forget my feelings, but I just couldn't get over her.

Recently our friend group broke up, so now all our hanging out will have to be one-on-one.\n\nI'm fine with that, but he's asking me to hang out every week or every second week, and I'd like to see him more on a once a month type basis. A long time ago he asked me out and though he swears he's over any sort of crush, sometimes I feel the dynamic remains to a slight extent. I don't want to be hanging out in a pseudo boyfriend-girlfriend capacity, which is what it feels like to me when we're getting dinner together all the time. We're at different life stages and I can't talk about girly stuff with him, plus in general I'm an introvert and probably wouldn't want to hang out that much even if he were a female friend. Final thing is there were a lot of toxic friendships in our group (long story involving a break-up), and he's still friends with everyone and therefore is a link back to all that drama (although there's no hard feelings, the rest of us have decided to go no contact with each other).\n\nHow do I tactfully tell him this? I texted him a polite variation of the above a few days ago in an attempt to set boundaries and he responded \"I don't feel the same way, but everyone's different. I totally understand\", but now he's already asked to hang out again. Another problem is that he doesn't have a huge social life (at least, from what I can tell), so part of his motivation is just to hang out with *someone*, I think, so it's hard not to feel bad turning down his requests. At the same time, I'm thinking this dynamic isn't that healthy for either of us.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "How to tactfully set boundaries with a guy friend I want to hang out with a bit less frequently?

The kicker is, the collections was apparently reported to the agency a month before I paid the debt in full, but it did not appear on my credit report until months later, and of course I didn't see it until now.\n\nThe [website for the agency] makes me cringe, and there's very little information about them; though a search for the company name or phone number returns a lot of scam/fraud reports. Which makes me think it could be a fraud attempt, but the credit report says that the private school reported it. I suppose a scammer could figure that information out, but how does it appear on all 3 reports, and why didn't it show up when I was paying the debt?\nTL;DR: ", "label": "Got in debt.

We've been so poor that we were near homeless, and we've also been a family making a decent 6 figure wage. My wife was raised in a family that has always been well off, as her dad is a VP at a large company. Her mother has always been a stay at home mom, as her dad's income was more than enough for the family. I come from a home where everyone has worked since they were first able.\n\nWe've been together a total of 7 years, and we started together in a tiny one bedroom apartment in college. She didn't complain when we lived there, but she understandably said she wanted to have more space. Since then, I've gotten a career and make pretty good money for my age. I showed her the houses that were available for what we make after budgeting and she wasn't satisfied. I told her that if she was willing to work, we could move into a large home, so she got a job.\n\nSince then she has decided that she hates work and isn't cut out for it. She talks about how much she hates it at least 2-3 times a week. I told her she could quit and we could move some place smaller, but she wants to have her cake and eat it too; she refuses to accept the idea that we'd have to move into a smaller home.

All I ever want is to find my life partner and enjoy life in a relationship. I know I am young to want that, but I don't enjoy hooking up and meaningless sex and relationships. The last year and 1/2 I was the happiest I have ever been because I love everything that goes along with a long term relationship. I enjoy parties but only if my SO is there, I enjoy everything that couples do, I love being loved by someone unconditionally, basically everything that comes along with being a couple I enjoy. I am going to be a freshman in college this fall and since the ending of my previous relationship all I want is another one, with someone who wants the same things I want.\n\nMy biggest fear is that in college many people are going to be looking to have fun and not looking to be in a long term relationship. \n\nJust a few questions.

I'm not willing to say anything because I don't want to damage our friendship so I've taken a hands-off approach, even as I worry myself to death and try to keep an eye on her (she tends to drink a bit too much and get fairly handsy at parties so a lot of guys take that as an invitation even when it isn't.) Last party a guy she thought was just being friendly tried to have sex with her and she got creeped out and the first thing she did was come find me.

The other day while sitting in my room staring at the wall and avoiding my textbook's gaze, I realized something about a show that I'm sure some of you have heard of... Pinky and the Brain!\n\nThroughout our lives, most - if not all - of us have always assumed a few things about the two protagonists in the show, Pinky and the Brain. The biggest and most important assumption that the show falsely presents is that \"Brain\" is more intelligent than \"Pinky\"\n\nIn fact, if you think about the show it is not a conflict between two mice of varying degrees of intelligence at all. It is actually a battle between good and evil. Pinky is far more cunning than Brain and successfully halts Brains plans to \"take over the world\" without Brain ever suspecting foul play. \n\nThe benefits that both mice enjoy thanks to Pinky's elaborate plans are threefold. Brain continues to feel good about himself. Pinky enjoys company in his otherwise lonely cage, and Brain's potential victims are kept safe by the hero of the story: Pinky.\n\nSo next time you watch the show... listen carefully to the tall, gangly mouse.

I don't think this is my worst story, but it is the most recent and awfully infuriating. Today a lady demanded her money back because, according to her, a piece of bed spring that was hanging out of the bottom of her bed injured not one, not two, but three of her family members. I guess the first injury didn't convince the other two so they had to jam their legs against it as well. The lady was also a member of our corporation's membership program, so they knew exactly how to complain if they didn't get what they wanted. These complaints would damage our score in the corporation and could cause some penalties, so it was just easier to give the lady what she wanted. We credited the money back to her debit card. The family had a 1 PM checkout, but by 2 PM they were still hanging around and in no hurry to leave. I finally lit a fire under their asses. When they did leave, they had three cars fully packed with what couldn't have been less than 12 people. They were in a 4 person room. For three nights. The housekeeper, who was supposed to get off at 3 PM, then spent the next 4 hours cleaning what had to be the most disgusting thing I ever saw. They left: 4 HUGE garbage bags of trash that were spilling across the floor, cigarette butts all over the floor, weird, smelly stains in the bathroom and tub, and, of course, no towels, washcloths, or tip. And the bed spring was fine. The lady then had the nerve to call for the rest of the day complaining that we never credited her account. I tried to explain as calmly as possible that the process takes 48-72 hours to go through, but she would hear none of it.

He had agreed to take some time apart from me to handle his issues, namely the marriage.\n\nSince leaving him, it has been a complete and total shit storm. He lies to me, changes his story, and has gotten mildly involved with other girls, which also bothers me, because he is putting them in the same position I was put in; getting involved with someone who is married.\n\nHe does a lot of things that are right on the line of being acceptable. When I call him on them, he will try to justify it, telling me I'm just being paranoid or that I was looking too far into things. He will try to blame things on me, or absolve himself of responsibility for being married, etc.\n\nSometimes, he makes me think that it will be okay. He'll buy me flowers, surprise me with dinners, swear up and down that he loves me and wants to fix it, etc. Usually after he gets caught.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Credit Card Advice for 18 Year Old\nPOST: After unsuccessfully attempting to get a car loan due to my lack of credit, I've recently decided that I need to get a credit card in order to build some sort of credit. I've kept a checking account with BoA for several years now, and I've seen the introductory CCs they offer, but I'd like to get something that actually offers a legitimate rewards program. I spend a fair amount (anywhere from 2-4k monthly), which currently earns me nothing as I only have a debit card. I've got a fairly stable income, but this doesn't help much considering that I have zero credit. \n\nSo, I was wondering exactly how the process of using a cosigner for a credit card works. My father has excellent credit and is willing to cosign for a CC (he did so for my car loan and got me a good APR). Will this allow me to be approved for any CC that he would be approved for if he were applying just for himself?\n\nLastly, I was wondering what cards are recommended for somebody in my situation. I take a few trips a year and do a fair bit of shopping, so a CC that offers travel/shopping rewards would be great. Although a good cash rewards CC would be just as helpful in my opinion. I was originally leaning towards AMEX green or gold, but as I understand it, they do not allow cosigners. Aside from that I was considering Chase Sapphire or freedom.

My first knee-jerk reaction was to reach for the center button (aka the only button) on the little device, but for some reason I reach with both hands and knock over my 3/4-full room-temperature beer with the inside of my left elbow. \n\nMy initial reaction is to immediately grab the beer, place it upright and cover it with my hand so that it doesn't overflow. To add to that brilliant plan, apparently my hand decides to instinctively cover it with my thumb instead, because hey, I have sorta thick thumbs, maybe my thumb is thick enough to stem this bottle's explosive...explosion action. Wrong. Cue the lukewarm beer foam spraying all over the kitchen. Guess they don't call it the champagne of beers for nothing.\n\nI drop the now foam-filled bottle onto the counter and look around. It was quiet for a good few seconds. It was actually pretty interesting to see how one half-bottle of warm beer can coat a kitchen in foam. The pantry door, the floor, the chairs, the counter, my uncle's shirt, all completely foamed. Thank God no phones or wall sockets got covered in foam, and the thermometer must've been waterproof because it was fine too. Without a word, I ran to the sink and grabbed a rag. After a half hour of apologizing and ferocious scrubbing, there was no more mess, but you could smell it. Hooooooly shit you could still smell it. The scene was clean, but with a stench entrenched.\nTL;DR: ", "label": "I'm a little popped up, my uncle asks me how to work some electronic thing he bought, I come in but knock over my beer and proceed to shower the kitchen in foam."}

About a year in, I started to see warning signs that this wasn't the kind of relationship I wanted. \n\nHe was drinking heavily every night, often lying to me about it, or concealing from me that he was drunk and high. He did several things while drunk that were upsetting - crashing into my neighbor's car, picking me up drunk when I needed a ride and lying about whether he'd been drinking, confessing later that he knew he'd been too drunk to drive. \n\nHe was emotionally disconnected from me, the sex went from very frequent to 1-2 times a month, and every effort I made to gently, kindly address the situation left him feeling attacked and abandoned. I tried to fix it, and he was not a willing participant in fixing it - it was like I was betraying him by pointing out that it was breaking, and then that it was broken. \n\nFinally it was too much, and I broke up with him. I am pretty certain that it was the right thing to do. \n\nBut I still miss him so badly. We thought we were going to be together forever. I feel too guilty to go online to try and date, for fear that he will see my profile and feel betrayed. I have had the opportunity to flirt with other people, and I just can't, I feel like I would be betraying him. I still love him. I still miss him. \n\nHe says he still loves me.

To be clear, I have tried talking to her about some of the things that bother me -- we can't do much about our schedules, that's just how life/work goes; she's not a super passionate or energetic person so there's no hope of getting her to be enthusiastic to do much more than sit on the couch and watch TV; and I brought up the amount of sex we have (it's 2 times a week, maximum, and it's almost always at my initiation. We would absolutely have less sex if I didn't push the subject), but no change there either.\n\nIt's making me irritable and we're getting into fights. There's really no point to that for either of us. We both deserve to be happy and that doesn't work when I really don't enjoy the prospect of being around her anymore.

Her father has had multiple DUI's has spent time in prison and is overall verbally abusive (has been physically abusive to her brother and was to her mom sometimes).

She was considering getting an apartment on her own, but my family happily took her in and she has been living with me since.\n\nSince then we have found out the reason he is moving back is because her fathers brother was murdered by the Cartel down in Mexico..( sounds insane I know).  Her whole family has been curious about his drug use based on how he has acted before( extremely paranoid).  I don't know the exact details, but it is believed he was either dealing drugs or helping manufacturer them.\n\nShe originally wanted no contact and nothing to do with him, but every time the year is about to end( when her mother died) she starts to become closed off and changes dramatically.

I have told her as long as he is alive I will have nothing to do with him. Period. \n\nAm I being unreasonable?

The house sold for $1.2 mil to a middle eastern family. The man is a home developer, and he supposedly bought our house because his wife wants to live in it with their family. \n\nThe man agreed to all terms, and told us to please move out of the house in a week. We complied, and got a year lease on a townhouse nearby while we look for another, smaller house. We shut off the water, canceled the pool man, shut off power, and canceled insurance. Two months later, the man still has not paid us any money, and keeps pushing back the payment date for the $30K deposit, and the main cash payment on the house.\n\nMy parents are a nervous wreck. This is a lot of money. We are worried about the house being broken into, because it is abandoned. I have been told that any damage will be on us, because no money has exchanged hands. We are afraid that the buyer might renege completely, and we do not have a backup buyer because we were assured the transaction would go smoothly. We now think he is jacking with us, and we may continue to have to pay the mortgage while waiting for this guy to get his shit together and pay up.\n\nWhat are our options besides lawyering up?

Shes the first girlfriend whos ever gonw out of her way to do things for me.

I am one of two people taking this course seriously and that other person is a girl (F 24). I dont get along with pretty much anyone else because I dont go out with them every weekend. I love my girlfriend and no matter what nothing will ever happen. BUT. I have such a close connection with this girl. I always want to be around her and I want her to want to be around me. I hate seeing her unhappy so im always worried about her and its even affecting my ability to focus.\n\nThese feelings confuse me because I know I would never cheat on my girlfriend 100% but I still feel guilty and Shitty and unfaithful. Ive always been touchy feely and always want someone to lean against when we watch a movie together but in all seriousness it has no sexual underlying reasons. Without sounding shallow I dont even really find this girl attractive.... She's the only one who's taken the time to get to know me and this constant distraction is absolutely killing me. \n\nAm I a shitty boyfriend for wanting comfort while im so far away assuming there are LITERALLY no underlying sexual elements?

Then for some reason, she literally told me that she thought she was a whore because she had multiple fuck friends. Obviously I was a bit shocked because I didn't think she thought of herself like that, but after maybe 2 seconds of disbelief, I told her that she wasn't. She 18 and.. well she has done some pretty outrageous stuff : to this day she has slept with 16 guys, 2-3 girls, she did two threesome and that's about it. Because of that she thinks she's a whore... I told her she wasn't, that she was just having fun and that it was totally fine but obviously it didn't really work, she still thought of herself badly. I'm a bit confused because I never EVER thought she was a whore, slut, skank or whatever. In my head, I believe that if I had has much success with girls, has she has success with guys, I would probably be dying from HIV because I would've slept with every girl I could and because I would've slept with so many girls I would probably be a hero among my friends. So why are people judging her because she likes to have sex? Why is it bad for her to have fun sexually speaking but not for me? Why is a girl who likes sex has much has the average guy being labelled as a whore? Am I the only one who thinks like that? Am I the only one who thinks society is fuck up to think this way? \n\nSo tell me reddit, what do you think about that?

They broke up about 2 weeks ago and my friend keeps saying that he is over her. I'm not gonna lie this girl is a little bit out of my league but I really think she likes me because one day last week we were talking in the hallway and she randomly asked to see my hand, she then proceeded to write her number on my hand. I had never previously asked her for it so I found it a bit weird, once again I'm not gonna lie I'm not exactly a Laddies' man. Fast forward about a week nothing has happened other than talking to each other in the hall and texting daily. Homecoming is coming up on a couple of weeks and of course with my luck it is girls ask guys. I thought to myself, \"Screw it, I'm just gonna ask her.\" This was yesterday, of course some other asshole asked her that morning. (I don't see her until lunch.) This guy is one of her ex's from last year and she said she might give him another chance. This guy has a little bit of an advantage over me because he is also a junior, taller, plays guitar, and has a sweet beard.

I replied, \"I'm going to warn you, and I speak from personal experience, the relationship ended the first time for a reason.\" She then texted back, \"You're right.\" The best I could think to say was, \"You do you, but consider this fair warning.\" No response.

With this group of friends we would literally hang out 4-5 times a week, and we'd have a lot of fun. After my bf and I started dating, some of our other friends from our group started dating as well. Needless to say we started slowing down on our group hang-outs. \n\nAnyway, my bf and I had a lot of fun in the beginning of our relationship, I'd go to his house just about every weekend and we'd watch a movie and then make out on the couch all night. That was all fun and games until his mom walked in on us in his room going at it. We sort of stopped hanging out at his house. \n\nNow, in the beginning of our relationship, we both acquired jobs at the same time. We used to hang out during the week maybe once or twice but now that our jobs are interfering, we just have no time to hang out anymore. Our hangouts occur maybe once a week and consist of he and I going out for dinner at 9:00 PM after I get off work, and then if we get lucky and his mom isn't home, we go to his house and hang out there or have sex. Granted, we've only had sex once and we were both black-out drunk.\n\nHe took my virginity, so I feel like this relationship should last and I should keep trying, but we don't see each other anymore!

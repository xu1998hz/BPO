4 months dating boyfriend of monogamous nature. Seems very comfortable and expects me to spend most nights over at his apartment or he stays with me.

Am afraid spending less time overâ“§ his apartment might be misconstrued as decrease in affection though naturally

Sitting in booking typing on phone now, sure will get out eventually but starving because pizza hut was tapped into too quickly and didn't get pizza.
3 year relationship seems great initially, lots of good memories, seems very stable emotionally and financially. Screams at me often, calls me cancer, laughs at me when I cry, goes away for weeks at a time and makes no attempt to even check on me.

2 year relationship with boyfriend of over two years has cheated previously, swears each time that it was a misunderstanding, has specific hangout that he never goes to when spending time with me personally, never takes me there, also never takes me on social media either.

1) When visualizing something in mind's eye usually very impressionistic and vague... can still describe object enough to know it's bedroom or whatever but never see image clearly like afterimage optical illusion.

Seems odd very few seem to discuss ability online so wondering if nature of ability varies greatly among people or perhaps just subjective definition of vividness plays role here. Can cultivate ability if naturally not present? Thoughts welcome.

2.5 year relationship living in larger home now, previously lived in smaller apartment so cleaning wasn't much of an issue.

6 months ago met girl with BF, hit it off straight away, inappropriate chemistry both ways, both view friendship as keeping options open, traveling for three months, wants me to spend two weeks traveling with her. Asked if open to hooking up while traveling, said absolutely not because reminds her too much of home life and would only ever hook up with someone she met there. Seems very extreme about entire situation, very cold demeanor trying to keep things platonic. Should I go with her anyway thinking hookup is inevitable and perhaps she was finally leaving BF for good? Crazy and stupid idea? Thoughts?

1 slightly acquaintanced guy has never expressed romantic interest in you, has not done anything inappropriate, has never said anything particularly inappropriate either. Bump into him at lunch time, he sees you dressed up and smiles and says "you look really nice today, by the way." How would you react in this situation? Give sincere thank you, or walk away quickly without further eye contact made? How would saying that make you feel personally? Would feel violated or objectified? Would boundary be crossed? Would anyone here be flattered by such a compliment? Thoughts?

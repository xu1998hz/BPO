22 year old dating 22 year old for two years. Everything's great except his avoidance of the ex-girlfriend topic. He is very evasive about their relationship, and I recently "stumbled" across some of his facebook messages which included a conversation with her; nothing major, just them planning to meet up. He has never mentioned them meeting up before, when he told me that he would just briefly let me know if he was going to hang out with another girl (not by my request, but his own). Is this just normal guy behavior that I shouldn't be concerned about? Or should I actually confront

Secondly, for the last 14 months she, at least, has been content to pretend as though I don't exist. Any time in passing we've seen each other, for instance, would be as though a complete stranger had

<strong>There are different time zones because of the Earth’s rotation and the difference in the Earth’s circumference at the equator. The Earth rotates about its axis every 24 hours, and as a result, different parts of the Earth experience different amounts of daylight. The difference in the Earth’s circumference at the equator results in the most significant difference in the times, with the eastern side of the Earth experiencing more daylight than the western side. As a result, countries on the eastern side of the equator experience daylight earlier in the morning and later in the evening than countries on the western side. These differences are called time zones.</strong>

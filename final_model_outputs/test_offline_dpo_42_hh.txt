<em>There are different time zones because of the Earth’s rotation and the way the Earth’s axis is tilted. The Earth spins on its axis every 24 hours, which creates a day and a night. The amount of time it takes for the Earth to spin is called a day. The Earth’s axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees to the plane of its orbit around the sun. This angle is called the latitude. The equator is the line where the Earth’s axis and its orbit around the sun are perpendicular. At the equator, the day and night are of equal length.

It’s also important to practice with your child, and to let them practice on their own, to build up their confidence.

<strong>Electric cars are generally more environmentally friendly than internal combustion engines.</strong>  This is because electric cars are powered by renewable energy, whereas internal combustion engines require non-renewable fuels.  Additionally, electric cars have a much lower carbon footprint per mile than internal combustion engines.

Additionally, the manufacturing process for electric cars can be quite energy intensive.  Overall, the best way to reduce the environmental impact of cars is to use them as little as possible and to car share or use public transportation.

It’s about showing up for practice, even when you’d rather be doing something else. It’s about doing what needs to be done, regardless of whether you feel like it.</strong>
